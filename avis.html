      <p> We're a group of content creators heading on a press trip to Japan to explore an off-the-beaten path itinerary -- together we can turn it into an epic road trip. </p>
      <br />
      <p>For one week in March 2019, we would cruise around Japan in an Avis rental car capturing photo & video content for your social media as well as promoting Avis to our audiences. </p>

      <p> I'm a content creator from Melbourne Australia currently living the dream in Bali, Indonesia. I love helping brands capture the essence of their personality and really telling a story through my work. </p>
      <p> I split my time between travelling the world, doing photography & videography for brands, and teaching the next generation of content creators through my school <a href="http://www.instituteofcode.com"> the Institute of Code.</a></p>
      <p> I'm also currently creating an online photography course that will teach students from all over the world how to take epic photos & edit them in lightroom and photoshop, which is launching early 2019. </p>

    <div class="col-8_sm-12 editable">
    
      <p>Every single day I have people asking my advice for the perfect photography workflow -- whether it's followers on instagram, students at Institute of Code, or fellow content creators on group trips. I'm always seeking and sharing the latest tools to make life as a photographer easier, and when I find brands that I love, I can't talk about them enough. </p>
      <p> My audience is predominately aspiring photographers, influencers and content creators. It's a premium audience that like to invest in quality (our course is a $4.5k investment), believe in the value of community, and generally love travel and adventure. </p>
